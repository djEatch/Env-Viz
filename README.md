# Env-Viz
p5.js visualisation of environments using JSON datasource or api call

This is a basic javascript HTML5 visualsation, that aims to draw a respresentation of a netowrked environment, using data from two sources, entities (the harware - servers, loadbalancers etc.) and relationships (what's linked to what, and using which protocol).
The aim is to have it looking like a proper "visio" network diagram, grouping servers by type and clustering where necessary.
in the future it would be nice to have details pop-up when each item is clicked.
